What Is It
==========

ShareBitcoins is a python script to send bitcoins to multiple addresses using BlockChain.info's [Send Many Transactions API](http://blockchain.info/api/api_send). Simply create a batch, define the number of shares for each bitcoin address, and send the transaction by providing a hexidecimal private key and a price per share.
